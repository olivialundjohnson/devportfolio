                    <p>
                       I am an award-winning director, producer, and media strategist transitioning my career from storytelling in media to driving impact in energy systems and sustainable business. My academic journey began with a degree in Environmental Studies from UC Santa Barbara and is now continuing at the Yale School of the Environment, where I am a candidate for a Master of Environmental Management. My current focus is on reshaping energy systems and advancing innovative, low-carbon business practices to address climate challenges. <br>

                        <br> Over the years, I've collaborated with leading brands and networks, including projects with Comedy Central, Fox, NBC, Paramount+, The Redford Center, and Netflix. From producing content to managing strategic initiatives, my experience spans both the creative and operational realms, allowing me to tackle complex issues with precision and creativity. My latest role with Climate Change AI inspired my interest in renewable energy systems and supply chain management, prompting my return to academia. I’m particularly eager to explore a data center transition to renewable energy, working on innovative solutions to reduce environmental impact.

                            I directed and edited a documentary following Clemson professor Dr. John Morse throughout a field study at Highlands Biological Field Station.

Now in his late 70s, John reflects on how his passion for teaching has influenced a generation of scientists and professionals, and grapples with what his legacy may look like once he leaves the classroom for good.
